## About me 👋

- I'm From Brazil 🇧🇷
- 👨🏻 27 y.
- I'm a Software Engineer and I work on the backend side, but I also like to study automation.

🚧 I am currently working on developing Web Rest APIs using Java, PostgreSQL and NoSQL applying microservices.

📚 I am currently studying Cloud, Task Automation, Clean Code, SOLID principles, Design Patterns, and good development practices to create scalable applications.

🤖 As side projects I intend to further develop my front end skills, such as VueJS and Mobile.
